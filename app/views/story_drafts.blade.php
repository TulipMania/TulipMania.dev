January 9, 1629

Groundskeeper Hennie says: "Good news, $characterName! Your mean great uncle, Rinus, died of bloody flux and left his tulip field to you! 

"As you know, tulips are of great value in this land. Grow good tulips and we --ahem, I mean, you-- could become a very rich man.

"I am at your service. Shall we go shopping?"

if(yes){
	go to store
} else{
	go to field.
}

2. TAKE A STROLL AROUND THE GROUNDS.
	A. Arjen, the town drunk, bets you ƒ3.00 that he can beat you swimming across the river. 
	Hennie says: "Be careful, master. Arjen, though a lush, is a magnificent swimmer. Also, the water is very cold. On the other hand, those three guilders could buy some much needed $itemBelowThreeGuilders."  
		AA. You lose!
			Arjen says: "Thank you, you fool. Time for some eau de vie!"
		AB. You win!
			Hennie says: "Congratulations, master. I'll make sure Mr. Arjen leaves the grounds and pays what he owes you."
		AC. Arjen drowned! You lose a day fishing his body out of the river. 	(But you get his ƒ3.00!) 
	B. You run into your old friend Bert van Praag from your days at the University of Groningen. He and his wife are on their way to a party at Count Kiesel's. Would you like to join them?
	Hennie says: "Make sure to give the driver a ƒ1.50 gratuity. You don't want to get a reputation for being a miser."
		BA. The countess has taken a liking to you. She asks if you 		would like to pair up with her for a short minuet. From across 		the room the count gives you a look. He is not happy.  
		Would you like to dance with her?
			BAA. Oh no! Count Kiesel has challenged you to a duel! If you accept you can get seriously hurt... or even DIE! But if you decline, your reputation will suffer and you will lose upwards of ƒ9.00 in sales. (No one wants to buy tulips from a coward!) 
				BAAA. The Count has shot you in the knee! You lose 
				three days of rest and ƒ12.30 in medical fees. 
				BAAB. The Count shot you in the face! The countess gives you mouth to mouth but, alas, you are dead. 
				BAAC. You have shot and killed the count! 
				The Countess says says: "Thank you so much. I hated that man. Please accept these SPECIAL SEEDS as a token of my appreciation."   
			BAB. The Count winks at you! He respects a man who will dance with the Countess. You gain a reputation for being a courageous man. People want to do business with you. You have an extra ƒ5.90.  
		BB. A man at the party by the name of Djavan says he's a childhood friend of yours from Den Burg. You don't recognize him, but he seems nice. 
		Djavan says: "I have some top-shelf opium with me. Would you like to smoke some out in the woods?"
			BBA. In a great opium dream you stumble into the drawing room and win ƒ12.00 at the poker table while speaking in tongues. 
			BBB. Oh no! You had a very interesting opium dream in which you vomited birds of all sorts...but you also lost your wallet with ƒ5.00 inside. 
			BBC. Djavan was actually a con artist! While you're in the middle of an opium dream about flying giant beetles, he steals ƒ8.00 from your pocket. 
			BBD. During an opium dream about Rinus you finally remember who Djavan is! You two hit it off and you even manage to sell him ƒ8.00 worth of tulips.

	C. You come across a cave that looks oh so much like one in which you used to play as a child. You decide to go in. A bear!\n Do you want to fight it or try to tame it? \n
	Hennie says: "I will meet you back at the house, master."
@stop
		CA. (IF TAME) You fool! This bear cannot be tamed. You lose two fingers and ƒ11.00 in medical fees. 
		CB. (IF FIGHT) Those morning push-ups have paid off! You kill the bear and sell its skin for ƒ14.00.
		CC. (IF TAME) You sing the bear a lullaby and it goes to sleep. You walk out silently. 
		CD. (IF FIGHT) You are able to land a few punches, but the bear bit your ear off! Spend ƒ12.00 in medical fees. 
	D. You come across the ghost of your uncle Rinus! Hennie doesn't see anything, he thinks you're crazy. \n
	Uncle Rinus says: \"My boy! I hope you're enjoying my tulip field. You need money? Buy ƒ19.87 worth of lottery tickets! trust me! Uncle Rinus, out!\" \n
	Do you want to buy the lottery tickets?
		DA. None of your tickets were winners. Apparently you are going insane from all that time working with tulips. Spend three days in the sanatorium and lose ƒ19.87. 
		DB. Uncle Rinus out? More like Uncle Rinus IN! You win ƒ390.78 and you make fun of Hennie for doubting you.
		DC. Only one of your tickets comes out a winner. You pocket ƒ6.54. Was it really due to Rinus or pure luck?

3. TAKE THE STAGECOACH TO EINDHOVEN.  
	A. While drinking in a tavern, an old veteran of the tulip fields lets you in on an old and very controversial new tulip-growing strategy. Would you like to implement it? 
		AA. Damn old man! Jealous of your youth and prospects, he took pleasure in tricking you! Lose ƒ25.05.   
		AB. The strategy worked! Pocket ƒ29.09.
		AC. The wise old man turned out to be the town idiot. His strategy for growing tulips affects your fields in absolutely no way. 
	B. While at a coffeehouse, a scientist approaches you. He'd like you to invest in wind energy. \n
	Hennie says: \"Windmills are witchcraft\" \n
	Would you like to invest ƒ31.87 in windmills?
		BA. YES! Your investment returns ƒ69.51.
		BB. Apparently Hennie was right. The windmills must be witchcraft. They all burnt down. You lose ƒ31.87
		BC. Your investment gives a modest return of ƒ9.01.
	C. An employee of the Dutch East India Company drops his coin pouch and you find it. \n
	Would you like to return it?
		CA. No! That man's rich enough!
			CAA. The police arrest you for theft. Lose three days and ƒ20.91 in fines. 
			CAB. You pocket the ƒ30.00 in the pouch. 
		CB. Of course! Praise God!
			CBA. The man says: \"Thank you, peasant. Now please leave and take your foul smell with you.\"
			CBB. The man thanks you and buys you drinks. Pocket ƒ11.93.

4. TAKE THE WAGONWAY TO AMSTERDAM.
	A. On no! While you were out in Amsterdam so ne'er-do-wells released a family of rats on your fields. The rats have eaten all your plants. 
	B.
