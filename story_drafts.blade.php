1.
Groundskeeper Hennie says: "Good news, $characterName! Your mean great uncle, Rinus, died of bloody flux and left his tulip field to you! 

"As you know, tulips are of great value in this land. Grow good tulips and we --ahem, I mean, you-- could become a very rich man.

"I am at your service. Shall we go shopping?"

if(yes){
	go to store
} else{
	go to field.
}

2. TAKE A STROLL AROUND THE GROUNDS.

POSSIBLE INITIAL SCENARIOS AT THE GROUNDS:
	A. Arjen, the town drunk, bets you ƒ3.00 that he can beat you swimming across the river. 
	Hennie says: "Be careful, master. Arjen, though a lush, is a magnificent swimmer. Also, the water is very cold. On the other hand, those three guilders could buy some much needed $itemBelowThreeGuilders."  
		AA. You lose!
			Arjen says: "Thank you, you fool. Time for some eau de vie!"
		AB. You win!
			Hennie says: "Congratulations, master. I'll make sure Mr. Arjen leaves the grounds and pays what he owes you."
		AC. Arjen drowned! You lose a day fishing his body out of the river. 	(But you get his ƒ3.00!) 
	B. You run into your old friend Bert van Praag from your days at the University of Groningen. He and his wife are on their way to a party at Count Kiesel's. Would you like to join them?
	Hennie says: "Make sure to give the driver a ƒ1.50 gratuity. You don't want to get a reputation for being a miser."
		BA. The count's wife has taken a liking to you. She asks if you 		would like to pair up with her for a short minuet. From across 		the room the count gives you a look. He is not happy.  
			Would you like to dance with her?
				BAA. Oh no! Count Kiesel has challenged you to a duel! If you accept you can get seriously hurt... or even DIE! But if you decline your reputation will suffer and you will lose ƒ9.00 in sales. (No one wants to buy tulips from a coward!) 
					BAAA.  
				BAB. 
				BAC.
		BB.
